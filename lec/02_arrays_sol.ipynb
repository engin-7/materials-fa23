    "# 0. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already encountered some simple Python data types like `int`, `float`, and `bool`. All of these were related to a single value and cannot be subdivided. These are known as **scalar** objects. In practice, programs will use *data structures*, which group multiple values together in a collection. For example, rather than representing daily maximum temperatures over a year using 365 floats: `day1 = 63.9`, `day2 = 64.6`, `day3 = 65.0`, ..., we could represent the data as a list of floats: `temp = [63.9, 64.6, 65.0, ...]`. This is a much more powerful and efficient construction, because we can perform operations on the list using similar syntax to the equivalent operations between scalar objects. For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of data structures is fundamental to scientific and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects which contain multiple values together are **non-scalar** objects. These are objects with internal structure, which can be subdivided (e.g., taking the first value). Because they have a structure, they are called *data structures*. Python has many useful built-in data structures, and we will encounter them quite often, such as strings, lists, and tuples. In this section, we will cover a special data structure for numerical computations, which is a NumPy array. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create 1-D and 2-D arrays\n",
    "* Manipulate 1-D and 2-D arrays\n",
    "* Perform arithmetic and comparison operations on arrays"

    "Performing numerical computations is central to almost all scientific and engineering applications, which is why there are many libraries dedicated to numerical computations. There are even languages that are specifically designed for such purposes, such as Fortran and MATLAB. In Python, NumPy is one of the most used modules for scientific and numerical applications. NumPy is short for \"Numerical Python\". It provides data structures and functions for numerical computation. NumPy is a large and extensive module, and this section is just a very brief introduction.\n",
