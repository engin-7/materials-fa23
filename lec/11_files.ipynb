    "While a program is running, its data is stored in random access memory (RAM). RAM is extremely fast, but it is also volatile, which means that when the program ends or the computer shuts down, data in RAM disappear. To preserve data for future use, share it with collaborators, or interact with external resources, you have to store it as a **file**. A file is a structured block of data stored within the file system of the computer's operating system. For instance, this lecture notebook itself is a file. In this section, you will learn how to use Python to read and write data in several common file formats.\n",

    "# 1. TXT Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A **text** file, often with an extension **.txt**, is a file containing plain text. Plain text represents characters without any special formatting like bold text, fonts, or font sizes. Despite their simplicity, text files serve as the foundation for storing and sharing information in a wide range of applications. Even if these files contain plain text, when you work with them in Python, your programs usually expect the file to follow a specific structure or format; that is, the data are organized in a specific way. \n",
