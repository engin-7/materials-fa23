    "Objects which contain multiple values together, such as the sequence of integers between 1 and 5: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, are **non-scalar** objects.

Because they have a structure, they are also called **data structures**. \n",

    "## 4.1. Tuples Are Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask, what's the difference between lists and tuples? If they are similar to each other, why do we need another sequence data structure? Well, tuples are created for a reason. Here's an excerpt from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are **immutable**, and usually contain a **heterogeneous** sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see below) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of named tuples). Lists are **mutable**, and their elements are usually **homogeneous** and are accessed by iterating over the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one important difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are immutable. Once elements in a tuple are defined, they cannot be changed. In contrast, as we saw earlier, elements in a list can be changed without any issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples find their utility in scenarios where data should remain unchanged and structured. For example, the list of weekday names is never going to change. If we store it in a tuple, we can make sure it is never modified accidentally in an unexpected place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2. Unpacking \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples, as well as other sequence/data structure types, can be accessed by unpacking. Unpacking is a shorthand syntax for assigning each of the elements of a data structure to different scalar variables. This requires that the number of variables on the left side of the assignment operator `=` equals the number of elements in the data structure. Otherwise, a `ValueError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unpacking Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> numeric_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    ">>> a1, a2, a3 = numeric_tuple\n",
    ">>> print(a1, a2, a3)\n",
    "1 2 3      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> numeric_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    ">>> a1, a2 = numeric_tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "\n",
    "      1 numeric_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "----> 2 a1, a2 = numeric_tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3. Tuple Operations and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to lists, using the `+` operator with tuples, like `tuple1 + tuple2`, won't perform arithmetic addition between the values of the two tuples. Instead, this will concatenate them into a combined tuple. Additionally, you can use the `*` operator for tuple repetition, just as we did with lists and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike strings and lists which have several methods, tuples have only two built-in methods:\n",
    "* `tuple.index(x)`: Return the index in `tuple` of the first item whose value is equal to `x`. Raises a `ValueError` if there is no such item.\n",
    "* `tuple.count(x)`: Return the number of times `x` appears in `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the only methods specifically associated with tuples in Python's standard library. Tuples don't have methods for adding, removing, or modifying elements because they are designed to be immutable. Tuples lack the extensive set of methods available to lists because tuples are intended to be immutable, and altering their contents contradicts this immutability principle."

    "# 5. Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Another sequence in Python is a `range`. It has very specific usages: create ranges of integers. We create a range by calling the `range()` function, which has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* `start`: an integer number specifying the starting position of the sequence. This argument is optional. If not specified, it defaults to 0.\n",
    "* `stop`: an integer number specifying at which position to stop the sequence (excluded). This argument is required.\n",
    "* `step`: an integer number specifying the increment in the sequence. This argument is optional and defaults to 1. The `step` can be positive or negative and the value in index `i` will simply be `start + step*i`\n",

    "The `range` type is an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for iterations, which we will discuss next. One of its notable advantages is its memory efficiency. Unlike regular lists or tuples, a `range` object consistently takes the same small amount of memory, regardless of the size of the range it represents, whether it is all integers from 0 to 10 or from 0 to 1000, as it only stores the `start`, `stop` and `step` values.\n",
