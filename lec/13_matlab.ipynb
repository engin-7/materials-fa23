    "\n",
    "Many engineers and scientists use MATLAB to analyze and design systems and products. MATLAB is primarily designed for numerical and matrix-based computation. As you'll see in this section, there are a lot of similarities between MATLAB and Python, so your Python experience should be a good head start for learning MATLAB. However, there are some important differences when comparing MATLAB and Python that you'll need to learn about to effectively switch over. In this section, we will go through basic MATLAB syntax concepts. To help ease the introduction, equivalent concepts are also shown in Python. This section is intended only to highlight the MATLAB way of doing some previously familiar things.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Evaluate the synatx differences between Python and MATLAB\n",
    "* Set up an environment for MATLAB that duplicates the majority of Python functions\n",
    "* Convert scripts from Python to MATLAB\n",

    "# 1. Syntax Differences Between MATLAB and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are syntax differences between MATLAB and Python. While the fundamental logic behind most operations remains similar, understanding these distinctions is crucial for a seamless transition between the two languages. MATLAB, short for \"MATrix LABoratory,\" treats everything as a matrix, whereas Python treats everything as a general object, which leads to some unique coding approaches in each language. \n",

    "For instance, in MATLAB, strings are a matrix of characters or a matrix of strings, while in Python, strings have their own type called `str`.\n",
