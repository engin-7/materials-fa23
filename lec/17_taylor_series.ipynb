    "# 0. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions like sine ($\\sin(x)$) and cosine ($\\cos(x)$) play a fundamental role in engineering and science but are often impractical to compute directly. In practice, these intricate functions are approximated through the use of simpler functions, such as polynomials. In fact, for many functions routinely encountered by engineers and scientists, explicit computation is virtually unattainable without these approximations. Taylor series is one of the best tools that enables approximating these complex functions by expressing them in terms of simpler polynomial expressions. Importantly, the applicability of Taylor series extends beyond the sine and cosine, encompassing a broad spectrum of functions commonly encountered in engineering and science.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, given that these are approximations, they inherently introduce some level of error. Hence, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of how these approximations work as well as their limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Formulate mathematical functions using Taylor series\n",
    "* Implement these Taylor series approximations in Python\n",
    "* Estimate the error resulting from these approximations"

    "A **Taylor series expansion** is a representation of a function by an infinite sum of polynomials around a point. The motive is that polynomials tend to be much easier to compute, take derivatives, integrate, and deal with overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point, $a$. Mathematically, the Taylor series of a function, $f(x)$, that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number $a$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = f(a)+\\frac {f'(a)}{1!} (x-a)+ \\frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2+\\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+ \\cdots = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)^n}{n!} \\label{eq:1}\\tag{1}$$\n",

    "which ignores the terms that contain $\\sin(0)$ (i.e., the odd terms). However, because these terms are ignored, the terms in this series and the Taylor series expansion defined above are off by a factor of $2n$. For example the $n = 1$ term in Eq.$\\eqref{eq:2}$ is the $n = 2$ term in Eq.$\\eqref{eq:1}$, and the $n = 2$ term in Eq.$\\eqref{eq:2}$ is the $n = 4$ term in Eq.$\\eqref{eq:1}$."

    "Of course if we can evaluate the function exactly, then we can compute the error. However, the motivation behind Taylor series is that these functions cannot be evaluated exactly. Thus, we are interested in estimating the error. A good estimate of the error is the next term in the expansion after our cut-off, which is the $N + 1$ term of the Taylor series. The next term in a Taylor series is often a good estimate of the error because it tends to be the largest remaining contribution to the approximation. \n",
