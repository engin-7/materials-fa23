    "In this section, we will introduce the basics of the Python Programming language. Effective computation requires understanding how data are stored and manipulated. Python has different built-in *symbols* that can be used to perform operations, such as addition, comparison, and logical, among others â€“ these symbols are known as **operators**. For example, `+` is the addition operator. In this section, you will be learning the different operators in Python and the operations they are used for. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform arithmetic operations\n",
    "* Distinguish between different basic data types\n",
    "* Use variables and the assignment operator in computations\n",
    "* Evaluate comparison and logical operations\n",
    "* Deal with errors \n",

    "\n",
    "Errors or mistakes in a program are often referred to as **bugs**. The process of tracking them down and correcting them is called **debugging**. It is useful to distinguish between error types in order to track them down more quickly. There are three basic types of errors that can occur:\n",
    "1. Syntax errors\n",
    "2. Runtime errors\n",
    "3. Logical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1. Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw above an example of a syntax error. The *syntax* of a language is its structure, the rules that govern the language. In English, syntax is how words and phrases are put together to form sentences. For example, subject-verb-object:\n",
    "* I like programming (valid syntax)\n",
    "* Like programming I (invalid syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has syntax, which is simply the rules that govern how Python understands your code. A syntax error occurs when the programmer writes an instruction using incorrect syntax and Python cannot understand what the programmer is saying. For most speakers of a natural language, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, so if a someone new to English said, \"Like programming I\", you might be able to understand what they meant. Python, however, is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error, Python will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> <b>TIP!</b> During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find them faster. Of course, if you're frustrated, ask a neighbor, a staff member, or the Internet for help.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other examples of syntax errors include:\n",
    "* trying to assign a variable to a number: `1 =  x`\n",
    "* inconsistent parentheses and/or brackets: `(1]`\n",
    "* missing quotes: `print(I like programming)`\n",

    "\n",
    "Even if all the syntax is correct (free of syntax errors), an error might still occur when running the code. Errors that occur during execution are called **runtime errors** (because the error does not appear until you run the program). They are also called **exceptions** (because they are usually caused by something exceptional in the code). If not handled, runtime errors will terminate the program. In this case we say the program has crashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some  examples of runtime errors include:\n",

    "* performing an operation on incompatible types: `1 + [2]`\n",

    "* trying to import a misspelled/missing module: `import mat`\n",

    "Exceptions are more difficult to find and are only detectable when a program is run. Python will still tell you where it thinks the problem is. We will learn later how to handle exceptions/runtime errors in Python.\n",

    "### 5.2.3. Logical Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, even if there are no syntax or runtime errors, and your code runs without raising any errors, that does not necessarily mean the code is correct. The third type of error we will discuss is called a **logic error**, which is the most difficult to detect. If there is a logical error, your program will run successfully, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but the result is incorrect due to a mistake in the logic. For example, consider you want to calculate the square root of 3: $\\sqrt{3}$ or $3^{0.5}$. Recall that power in Python are represented using `**`, and thus this can be computed using `3 ** 0.5`. If you use `3 * 0.5` instead, your code will run without raising any errors. However, the result would be $3\\times 0.5$, which is incorrect due to a logical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of logical errors include:\n",
    "* mixing up a variable name\n",
    "* getting operator precedence wrong\n",
    "* making a mistake in logical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When a logical error occurs, Python will not do what you *wanted it to do*. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you (incorrectly) *told it to do*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although logic errors seem unlikely to occur, or at least easy to find, when programs become longer and more complicated, these types of errors are very easy to generate and tricky to find. When logic errors occur, you have no choice but to meticulously comb through each line of your code until you find the problem. For these cases, it is important to know exactly how Python will respond to every command you give and not make any assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3. Avoiding Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many techniques that can help prevent errors and make it easier for you to find them when they occur. Making errors and learning how to fix them is part of the learning process. Below are some good habits to minimize making errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plan your program: start with an outline of your program that addresses all the tasks you want your program to perform and in the order in which it should perform them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Many novice programmers, eager to finish their assignments, will rush to the programming part without properly planning out the steps needed to accomplish the given task. Haphazard planning results in equally haphazard code that is full of errors. Time spent planning out what you are trying to do is time well spent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Test your program often: program in steps and test each step using test cases for which you know the answer, and code enough cases to be confident that the function is working properly. For example, if you are writing a function that tells you whether a number is prime or not, you should test the function for inputs of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 97. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The tendency to rush one's coding is a mistake even proficient programmers are guilty of; they will write pages and pages of code without testing and then will spend hours trying to find a small error somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep your program clean: you should keep your program as clean as possible, free of unnecessary clutter. There are many strategies to do so: \n",
    "    * Assign your variables short, descriptive names\n",
    "    > Still, not all descriptive names are good: `theNumberOfRandomNumbersToBeAdded` is a poor variable name even if it is descriptive.\n",
    "    * Comment frequently\n",
    "    > No commenting is bad practice, but over-commenting can be equally bad. You decide what level of commenting is appropriate.\n",
    "    * Write your code in the fewest instructions possible\n",
    "    > For example: \n",
    "    > ```python\n",
    "    y = x ** 2 + 2 * x + 1\n",
    "    > ``` \n",
    "    > is better than: \n",
    "    > ```python\n",
    "    y = x ** 2\n",
    "    y = y + 2 * x\n",
    "    y = y + 1\n",
    "    >``` \n",
    "    > Even if the outcome is the same, every character you type is a chance that you will make a mistake; therefore, reducing how much code you write will reduce your risk of introducing errors. Additionally, writing a complete expression will help you and other people understand what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.4. Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with best practices, errors will occur. So, it is important to be able to identify and fix them. Errors are often referred to as bugs, and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called debugging. One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually challenging and interesting parts of programming. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with errors or results that are not what you expect. These are your clues to infer what led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually quite straightforward to debug: the error message shows the line where the error occurred, and it should be easy to find it and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors can be a little more difficult to debug: the error message and the traceback can tell us where the error occurred, but that doesn't necessarily tell us what the problem is. Sometimes they are caused by something obvious, like an incorrect variable name, but sometimes it's not clear which of many variables has an unexpected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical errors are the most difficult to fix because they don't cause any errors in the code. All that we know is that the code is not behaving as it should be. A quick and simple way of testing that a program for logical errors, for example, is to insert `print()` statements at different lines to check how the output is changing. This will output the intermediate results which were calculated on that line. Most programmers intuitively do this as they are writing a function, or perhaps if they need to figure out why it isn't doing the right thing."
