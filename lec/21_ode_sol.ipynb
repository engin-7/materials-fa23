    "Differential equations are relationships between a function and its derivatives. These equations arise when the rate of change is related to the function itself and/or its independent variable(s). Differential equations are fundamental tools for modeling dynamic systems in various engineering and scientific disciplines. Consider a basic example of a car's acceleration in relation to its position. In this case, a simple differential equation emerges, connecting the car's acceleration (the second derivative of position) with its position. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with differential equations, the goal is to find the unknown function that satisfies this relationship between a function and its derivatives. However, in general exact solutions to differential equations are either too difficult to obtain or simply not available. Therefore, numerical solutions are critical to making these equations useful for designing and understanding engineering and scientific systems. \n",

    "This section focuses on a specific subset of differential equations: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with specified initial values, commonly referred to as initial value problems (IVPs). \n",

    "# 1. Differential Equations \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Definition of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In various engineering and scientific disciplines, we encounter two main types of equations: algebraic and differential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algebraic Equations:**\n",
    "An algebraic equation is limited to basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, often involving polynomials. An example is $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$. Solving an algebraic equation revolves around finding specific values, known as roots, that satisfy $f(x) = 0$. The unknown in this case represents distinct numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differential Equations:**\n",
    "Conversely, a differential equation relates functions and their derivatives. For example, $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$ involves an unknown function and its derivatives. The objective in solving a differential equation is to identify the function(s) that satisfy the differential equation. Unlike algebraic equations, the unknown here isn't a specific value but an entire function, making the solution of a differential equation more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Types of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of differential equations: ordinary and partial. While Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) focus on a single independent variable, typically time, and describe the behavior of functions in that context, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) extend this to involve multiple independent variables in multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**\n",
    "ODEs are mathematical expressions involving an unknown function and its derivatives with respect to a single independent variable. An example is $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$. The independent variable is usually time or a single spatial dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**\n",
    "On the other hand, PDEs involve unknown functions and their partial derivatives with respect to several independent variables. An example is $x\\dfrac{\\partial f(x, t)}{\\partial x} + t\\dfrac{\\partial f(x, t)}{\\partial t} - f(x, t) = 0$. PDEs involve considering how the function varies across multiple dimensions (e.g., time and space).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classifying differential equations based on the number of independent variables, we can distinguish between linear and nonlinear differential equations. We will focus on ODEs hereafter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear vs. Nonlinear ODEs:**\n",
    "An ODE is linear when the unknown function and its derivatives in the equation appear only with a power of one and are multiplied by constants. If the functions and/or derivatives are raised to a power different from one and/or are multiplied by one another, the ODE would be nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of linear ODEs:\n",
    "* $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$\n",
    "* $f''(x) + f(x) + e^x = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of nonlinear ODEs:\n",
    "* $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f^2(x) = 0$\n",
    "* $f''(x) + 2f'(x)f(x) = 0$\n",
    "* $f'(x) = \\cos(f(x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Order of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative that appears in the equation. Below are some examples for different orders of differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "* First order (the highest order derivative is 1): \n",
    "    * $\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 3t + 2$\n",
    "    * $\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = y^2 + 3t + 2$\n",
    "* Second order (the highest order derivative is 2):\n",
    "    * $\\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2}+ 2 \\dfrac{dy}{dt}+y = 0$\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 1.4. Initial Value Problem    \n",
    "\n",
    "An Initial Value Problem (IVP) is a specific type of differential equation that comes with initial conditions. These initial conditions provide the starting values for the unknown function and its derivatives at a particular point. Solving an IVP involves finding the function that not only satisfies the given differential equation but also aligns with the provided initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Solution:**\n",
    "The general solution of a differential equation represents the family of all possible solutions without specifying particular values for any arbitrary constants that may arise during the solving process. For example, in the case of the differential equation $y' = y$, we need to find a function such that its first derivative is equal to the function itself. An obvious solution in this case is $y = C e^t$, where $C$ is some arbitrary constant. This solution is known as a general solution because it involves an arbitrary constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Particular Solution:**\n",
    "A particular solution, on the other hand, is a specific solution derived from the general solution by assigning particular values to any arbitrary constants present. These values are determined based on additional information, such as initial conditions in an IVP. An example of an initial condition could be a known value of the function at $t=0$. For example, assume we know that $y(t=0)=y_0=5$. We can then substitute the initial condition into the general solution to assign values to the arbitrary constants. For the previous example with $y = C e^t$, and using the initial condition $y_0 = C e^0 \\rightarrow C=5$. Hence, the solution that satisfies the given differential equation and the initial condition is $y= 5 e^t$, which is known as the particular solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will discuss several methods of numerically approximating the solution to initial value problems on a numerical grid. Although initial value problems encompass more than just differential equations in time, we will generally use time as the independent variable. We also use several notations for the unknown function: $f(t)$ and $y$ and several notations for its derivatives: $f^{\\prime}(t), f^{(1)}(t), \\dfrac{df(t)}{dt}$, and $\\dot{f}$, whichever is most convenient for the context."

    "# 2. Numerical Solutions to First Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y'=F(t, y)$ be a first order ODE, where $F$ is a known function that returns the derivative. Numerical methods play a crucial role in solving differential equations, providing approximate solutions when analytical solutions are challenging or unavailable. We will first explore first order ODEs and then discuss solutions to higher order ODEs next. Euler's Method, Midpoint Method, and Heun's Method are three techniques for numerical integration of ODEs. All three methods share a common approach of predicting a future value $y_{i+1}$ using the known current value $y_i$ and a linear approximation: $y_{i+1} = y_i + h \\cdot slope$, where $h$ is the step size. The methods differ in how they estimate the $slope$, which influences the accuracy of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the core idea is to use the current information (value and slope) to take a step forward and update the solution. Here's a concise summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Euler's Method:** Uses the slope at the current point $(t_i, y_i)$\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Midpoint Method:** Uses the slope at the midpoint of the interval $(t_{i+1/2}, y_{i+1/2})$\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heun's Method:** Uses the average of the slopes at the current point and the predicted point $(t_i, y_i)$ and $(t_{i+1}, y^*_{i+1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "While all three methods share a common framework of advancing from the current point to predict the next, the nuances in how they estimate the slope influence their accuracy and suitability for different types of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we assume that we have a known initial condition $(t_0, y_0)$ and are interested in estimating the numerical solution using $N$ steps between an initial time and a final time $[t_0, t_f]$, such that $t_f = t_0 + Nh$.\n",

    "Euler's Method is a straightforward numerical technique that approximates the solution of a first-order ODE using the slope at the current point $(t_i, y_i)$ (left endpoint of each subinterval). Recall that we have the first order ODE $y'=F(t, y)$, where $F$ is the derivative function. It follows that the slope at the current point is $y'_i = F(t_i, y_i)$.

    "Let's consider an example of water flow between three connected tanks. If the three water tanks initially have different water heights, the water will flow from the tank with a higher water level to the tanks with lower water levels through the connecting pipes. In a physical system, this is analogous to a fluid flow or hydraulic system. The rate of flow will depend on the difference in water levels between the connected tanks and the properties of the connecting pipes (e.g., diameter, length, etc,). If the difference in water levels is significant, you might observe a noticeable flow, and the water levels in the tanks will tend to equalize over time. In this example, we will assume that the connecting pipe between tanks 1 and 2 is wider than that between tanks 2 and 3, as shown in the illustration below. \n",
