    "\n",
    "Numerous problems in engineering and science can be described or approximated by linear relationships. For example, if you combine resistors in a complicated circuit, you will obtain a system of linear relationships. Similarly, if you study small deformations of rigid structures, you will also get a system of relationships. In fact, it is difficult to think of any science or engineering field in which relationships of these kind are not fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of linear relationship is contained in the field of linear algebra, and this section provides a basic overview of some basic linear algebraic vocabulary and concepts that are important for later chapters. However, the information in this section is in no way comprehensive and should not be considered a substitute for a full linear algebra course.\n",

    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Demonstrate an understanding of a variety of linear algebra concepts and calculations\n",
    "* Use Python and MATLAB tools to perform various linear algebra calculations\n",
    "* Write a system of linear equations in matrix form\n",

    "1. No solution exists for $x$\n",
    "2. There is an infinite number of solutions for $x$\n",
    "3. There is one, unique solution for $x$\n",

    "### 4.2.1. Square Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion below only applies when $m = n$, that is, the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns and $A$ is a square matrix. If $A$ is a square matrix, we can solve for the unknowns by multiplying each side of the equation by $A^{-1}$. This results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A^{-1}Ax = A^{-1}b\\rightarrow Ix = A^{-1}b\\rightarrow x = A^{-1}b$$\n",
