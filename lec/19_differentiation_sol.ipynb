    "\n",
    "In various engineering and science disciplines, understanding how physical quantities change over time, space, and other dimensions is crucial. Mathematically, the rate at which these changes occur is modeled using derivatives. Although there is an extensive [set of rules](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-rules.html) for computing derivatives analytically, these rules can be cumbersome for some functions. Moreover, a more critical challenge arises in practical scenarios where the underlying mathematical function may not be explicitly known, and only a set of discrete data points is available. In such cases, numerical computation of derivatives becomes a necessary alternative to analytical methods. Numerical differentiation methods provide a practical means to approximate derivatives in scenarios where analytical solutions are impractical or unavailable.\n",

    "Calculating the error exactly, similar to the examples above, is generally not possible, as the actual derivative is the unknown we are trying to estimate. Instead, we focus on estimating the order or magnitude of the error. One common way of describing the order of the error is using Big-O notation, which we have previously used to describe the time complexity of different algorithms. In general, Big-O notation is used to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions, indicating how fast a function grows or declines. In this case, we will use it to describe the order at which the error in numerical differentiation grows or declines as a function of the spacing $h$.\n",
