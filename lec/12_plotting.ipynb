    "\n",
    "Data visualization plays a pivotal role in the fields of engineering and science, serving as a powerful tool for understanding complex data and conveying result effectively in a report, a publication, a presentation, or other means. Python has emerged as a popular language for data analysis and visualization, owing to its versatility and an array of dedicated libraries. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of data visualization, with a primary focus on Matplotlib – the cornerstone of Python's data visualization stack. There are other popular libraries, some of which that build on Matplotlib, including Seaborn, GGplot, among others. In this section, you will develop some of the fundamental graphical methods and will have enough familiarity to explore any other methods. Matplotlib is extensive, and our goal is not to cover every feature. We will cover the basic necessities for Matplotlib, which should enable you to explore other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a variety of data visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more\n",
    "* Employ Matplotlib to generate and customize static data visualizations in Python\n",
    "* Explore advanced data visualization techniques, such as 3D plots, heatmaps, and geographical mapping\n",
    "* Apply best practices in data visualization, including labeling and color choices"

    "# 1. Introduction to Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a versatile Python library used for creating a wide range of visualizations, including static, animated, and interactive plots. The [Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html#gallery) contains example plots. Most of the Matplotlib utilities are under the *pyplot* submodule. To use *pyplot*, we need to import it first. A conventional way to import it is to use `plt` as a shortened name: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib offers two primary approaches to creating visualizations:\n",
    "1. Explicit Axes Interface (Object-Oriented)\n",
    "    > This approach uses methods on a Figure or Axes object to build a visualization step by step. This gives you more control for customizing your plots, which is especially useful for complex plots.\n",
    "2. Implicit Pyplot Interface\n",
    "    > This approach keeps track of the most recent figure and Axes created, and plots to the object it thinks the user wants. In this case, we rely on `pyplot` to implicitly create the Figure and Axes. This is convenient for simple, quick plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss the explicit `Axes` interface first, and then see how we can achieve similar plots using the implicit `pyplot` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Creating a Figure Object \n",
    "\n",
    "To start crafting your visualization, you will need a Figure object. We can create a new Figure object using `plt.figure()`. Each call to `plt.figure()` generates a **new** Figure object. The `plt.figure()` function has many optional parameters. A full list can be found in the documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html). Some of the optional parameters that you can specify inside `plt.figure()` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6.4, 4.8), dpi=100, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* `figsize`: specify figure width and height in inches, e.g.: `figsize = (6,4)` (optional, default: `figsize = (6.4,4.8)`)\n",
    "* `dpi`: specify the resolution of the figure in dots per inch, e.g.: `dpi = 300` (optional, default: `dpi = 100`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above creates a new figure, which can be thought of as a single container that will contain all the objects representing axes, graphics, text, and labels. We have used the variable name `fig` to refer to the Figure instance, but we could have used any other variable name. The image below shows several Matplotlib elements composing a Figure object.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Creating a Single Axes Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created a new Figure, we can create an *Axes* object, which we can use to plot a variety of plot types. We can have one or multiple Axes (i.e., subplots) in the same figure. Each Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects, which form a bounding box with ticks and labels that will eventually contain the (sub)plot elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a new Axes using `plt.axes()`, which can take optional parameters as shown in the documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.html). To create a single 2-D Axes, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax = plt.axes()\n",

    "Using `Axes` explicit interface gives you more control for customizing your plot. Using `pyplot` implicit interface, on the other hand, leaves you with less control over your plot but the advantage is that it saves you from writing more lines of code and is easier and handy when dealing with single plot. Using `Axes` explicit interface allows you to keep references to the objects, which makes it easy to backtrack and operate on an old Axes – this cannot be easily achieved with the `pyplot` implicit interface. \n",

However, in many cases, it is helpful to have different views of data side by side, which is the concept of subplots: groups of several Axes that exist together within a single Figure. These subplots might be grids of plots or other more complicated layouts. There are different methods for creating subplots using Matplotlib, some of which serve the same purpose. We will discuss the following methods:\n",

Every time you call `plt.axes()`, it creates a new empty Axes which you can use to plot data. \n",

We can control the dimensions of the Axes to allow displaying multiple Axes in the same Figure. `plt.axes()` takes an optional argument that is a list of four numbers which numbers represent `[left, bottom, width, height]` in the figure coordinate system, ranging from 0 at the bottom left of the figure to 1 at the top right of the figure.\n",
