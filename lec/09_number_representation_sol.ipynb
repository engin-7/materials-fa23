    "An important part of understanding number representations is appreciating how computer storage works. Computer memory is essentially a continuous sequence of 0s and 1s, where each of these digits is known as a **bit** (abbreviation for <strong><u>bi</u></strong>nary digi<strong><u>t</u></strong>). So, each bit can take one of two values: either 0 or 1, which is why representing it in terms of binary makes sense. A bit is the smallest building block of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have a fixed number of bits that they are capable of storing at one time, and the number of bits controls how many numbers can be stored, the smallest and largest possible numbers, etc. For example, if all bits are used to represent unsigned integer binary numbers, and we have eight bits, then the maximum number that can be stored is:\n",

If all bits are used to represent unsigned integer numbers, the largest number that can be stored is $2^n-1$ ($base$-$10$).

On the other end, *dynamically-typed* languages, like Python, are more flexible where the interpreter determines the type dynamically.

    "So, what have we gained by using IEEE 754 versus binary? Using 64 bits binary gives us $2^{64}$ numbers (integers), which is ~18 quintillion numbers ($10^{18}$). Since the number of bits does not change, IEEE754 double precision also gives ~18 quintillion numbers. In binary, numbers have a constant spacing between them. As a result, you cannot have both range (i.e., large distance between minimum and maximum representable numbers) and precision (i.e., small spacing between numbers). Controlling these parameters would depend on where you put the decimal point in your number. IEEE 754 overcomes this limitation by using very high precision at small numbers and very low precision at large numbers. So, more of the numbers are allocated near 0 than near larger magnitudes. This limitation is usually acceptable (although could lead to problems if not accounted for) because the gap at large numbers is still small relative to the size of the number itself.\n",

    "# 4. Numerical Errors\n",

    "Since floating point numbers are represented in computers as base 2 fractions, not all numbers can be stored with perfect precision. Numerical errors arise from the use of approximations to represent exact mathematical operations and quantities. We will discuss two common numerical errors:\n",
    "1. Round-off errors: difference between an approximation of a number used in computation and its exact (correct) value.\n",
    "2. Truncation errors: difference between an actual and a truncated, or cut-off, value.\n",

    "## 4.1. Round-off Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a round-off error, also called rounding error, is the difference between the result produced by an algorithm and the exact (correct) value. Rounding errors are due to the finite number of bits available to represent numbers. For example, if we want to assign the value 1/3 to a variable, the true value will be 0.333333333.... However, no matter how many decimal digits we choose, there will always be a round-off error. Increasing the number of bits in a representation reduces the magnitude of possible round-off errors, but will not completely eliminate it. Round-off errors cause surprising results in some cases.\n",
