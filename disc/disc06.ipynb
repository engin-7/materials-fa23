    "1.   Start with the entire sorted collection of data.\n",

    "3.   Compare the target value `x` with the elements at these two midpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   If `x` is equal to  `mid_left` or `mid_right`, you have found the target.\n",
    "    *   If `x` is less than `mid_left`, narrow the search interval to the leftmost one-third and perform another ternary search on that interval.\n",
    "    *   If `x` is greater than `mid_right`, narrow the search interval to the rightmost one-third and perform another ternary search on that interval.\n",
    "    *   If `x` is greater than `mid_left` and less than `mid_right`, narrow the search interval to the middle one-third and perform another ternary search on that interval.\n",
