    "Write a Python function `process_name()` that takes a single argument called `name`, which is a string containing a person's first and last name, with a single space separating them. Your function should return three values:\n",
    "1. The first name with the first letter only in uppercase\n",
    "2. The last name with the first letter only in uppercase\n",
    "3. The  initials in uppercase (first letter from the first name and first letter from the last name)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `name` could be all lowercase, uppercase, or a mix of both. Also, assume that the first name is a single word and the last name is also a single word.\n",

    ">>> process_name('John Doe')\n",

    ">>> process_name('john doe')\n",
