    "## Question 1: Logistic Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic equation is a simple differential equation model which can be used to relate the change in population $\\dfrac{dP}{dt}$ to the current population, $P$.  The logistic equation models bounded growth as opposed to earlier exponential growth models which fail to take into account constraints on the maximum population. These constraints arise from the fact that large populations will necessarily compete for resources (e.g. food, living space, etc.), while small populations are not generally constrained by these factors and can grow exponentially. The logistic equation reads\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{dP}{dt} = rP\\left(1−\\frac{P}{K}\\right)$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "* $r$ is the growth rate in the absence of limited resources; i.e. how quickly the population would grow if infinite resources were available,\n",
    "* $K$ is the carrying capacity, or the maximum population the ecosystem is able to sustain indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic equation can be used in a variety of other contexts, including machine learning, cancer treatment, economics and language adoption among others. While the interpretation of the parameters may change, the potential applications are all characterized by an exponential growth followed by a gradual saturation which the logistic equation is able to model.
