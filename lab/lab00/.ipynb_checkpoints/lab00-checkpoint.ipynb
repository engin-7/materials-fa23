    "## About Lab 00\n",
    "Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one. You cannot learn to program just by watching someone else do it. You will need to be actively engaged in the learning process to develop your own understanding of the material through coding practice in lab sections and assignments. This is just a very simple, one-question assignment. The objective of this assignment is to acquaint you with the process of working on lab assignments and familiarize you with the procedure for submitting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Autograder\n",
    "You will be provided with some test cases (i.e., sample input data) and associated answers (i.e., expected outputs) that you can use to help check your code. The provided test cases are not exhaustive, and it is your responsibility to ensure that your code works in general, not just for a few supplied test cases. We may use additional hidden test cases in grading your lab assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the first cell, Initialize Otter**, to import the autograder and submission exporter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer cells\n",
    "Throughout the assignment, replace `...` with your answers. We use `...` as a placeholder and theses should be deleted and replaced with your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answers must be in the cells marked `# ANSWER CELL`, including your final calculation/code. However, do not perform scratchwork in `# ANSWER CELL`. Add a new cell to perform your scratchwork. Your scratchwork will not be graded and does not need to be included in your submission unless otherwise noted.\n",
